# Beginning Python Projects

This is a series of 10 projects taken from the book Beginning Python, From Novice to Professional from Magnus Lie Hetland . I realized how I never completed all of the projects included in this book.

Since I will be using Python 3.x, and the book uses Python 2.x, parts of the code need to be updated. Some other technologies used in the book may also be obsolete today, so I will have to seek out for some other solutions.

This series of projects is intended as brush up on my Python knowledge (since I haven't coded in this language in a while).
